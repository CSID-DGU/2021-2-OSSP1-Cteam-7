There is given an integer array A of size N denoting the heights of N trees. Lumberjack Ojas needs to chop down B metres of wood. It is an easy job for him since he has a nifty new woodcutting machine that can take down forests like wildfire. However, Ojas is only allowed to cut a single row of trees. Ojas's machine works as follows: Ojas sets a height parameter H (in metres), and the machine raises a giant sawblade to that height and cuts off all tree parts higher than H (of course, trees not higher than H meters remain intact). Ojas then takes the parts that were cut off. For example, if the tree row contains trees with heights of 20, 15, 10, and 17 metres, and Ojas raises his sawblade to 15 metres, the remaining tree heights after cutting will be 15, 15, 10, and 15 metres, respectively, while Ojas will take 5 metres off the first tree and 2 metres off the fourth tree (7 metres of wood in total). Ojas is ecologically minded, so he doesn't want to cut off more wood than necessary. That's why he wants to set his sawblade as high as possible. Help Ojas find the maximum integer height of the sawblade that still allows him to cut off at least B metres of wood. /splitsign/BinarySearch,ojas,cutting,lumberjack,woodcutting,trees,cut,tree,cuts,sawblade,forests,

Now each day the orange zones become more fatal. After d days, all the locations within a euclidean distance of d of a particular orange zone can be affected by this zone. They know N orange zones, each of whose coordinates are given by (A[i][0], A[i][1]). Now, a location is considered a red zone if it is affected by at least B orange zones.

“The Second Amendment was adopted to protect the right of the people of each of the several States to maintain a well-regulated militia. It was a response to concerns raised during the ratification of the Constitution that the power of Congress to disarm the state militias and create a national standing army posed an intolerable threat to the sovereignty of the several States. Neither the text of the Amendment nor the arguments advanced by its proponents evidenced the slightest interest in limiting any legislature’s authority to regulate private civilian uses of firearms. Specifically, there is no indication that the Framers of the Amendment intended to enshrine the common-law right of self-defense in the Constitution.”“Because of our two-party system, voters often find themselves voting for the ‘lesser of two evils,’ rather than a candidate they really feel would do the best job. . . ."Since most states distribute their electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the smaller party has no chance to gain support without seeming to take this support from one of the major parties. Few people will support a party that never wins, especially when they are supporting that party at the possible expense of their least favorite candidate taking power.”". . . without debate, without criticism, no administration and no country can succeed—and no republic can survive . . . that is why our press was protected by the First Amendment--the only business in America specifically protected by the Constitution . . . ”"When the Articles of Confederation were drafted, Americans had little experience of what a national government could do for them and bitter experience of what an arbitrary government could do to them. In creating a central government they were therefore more concerned with keeping it under control than with giving it the means to do its job."“The character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done. The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.”“9/11 significantly increased political participation of the affected populations . . . Families and neighbors became more involved in politicized activities, including the selection of party nominees and in providing financial support to favored candidates . . . Finally, although families, and to a lesser extent neighbors, became more involved in their own parties’ activities, there was an average shift in allegiance to the Republican Party.”“The Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not only because those classifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate motives, but also because every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all. . . . Undoubtedly there are other ways to ‘better’ the education of law students aside from ensuring that the student body contains a ‘critical mass’ of underrepresented minority students.“The defeat of Robert Bork’s 1987 Supreme Court nomination was a watershed event that unleashed what Stephen Carter has called ‘the confirmation mess.’ There was no question that Bork was a highly qualified nominee. He was rejected not because of any lack of qualification, or any impropriety, but because of his stated judicial philosophy: how he would vote as a judge.”“[I]t has already been incontrovertibly shown that on the present occasion a bill of rights was totally unnecessary, and that it might be accompanied with some inconveniency and danger if there was any defect in the attempt to enumerate the privileges of the people. This system proposes a union of thirteen sovereign and independent states in order to give dignity and energy to the transaction of their common concerns. It would be idle, therefore to countenance the idea that any other powers were delegated to the general government than those specified in the Constitution itself.”“Thus every man, by agreeing with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself under an obligation to everyone in that society to submit to the decisions of the majority, and to be bound by it. Otherwise—that is, if he were willing to submit himself only to the majority acts that he approved of—the original compact through which he and the others incorporated into society would be meaningless . . .” /splitsign/politics,militia,firearms,amendment,militias,constitution,regulated,protect,legislature,sovereignty,regulate,

In 1988 and 1989, the Pennsylvania legislature amended its abortion control law. The changes included requiring a 24 hour waiting period for the procedure and that a married woman must notify her husband that she intends to have an abortion. In a 5-4 ruling, the Court upheld most of the Pennsylvania laws because they did not create a “substantial obstacle” to a woman seeking an abortion. This became known as the undue-burden test.“This week, we have twice seen Supreme Court Justices violating their judicial oaths. Yesterday, the Justices re-wrote Obamacare, yet again, in order to force this failed law on the American people. Today, the Court doubled down with a 5-4 opinion that undermines not just the definition of marriage, but the very foundations of our representative form of government. . . . That is unacceptable. On the substantive front, I have already introduced a constitutional amendment to preserve the authority of elected state legislatures to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman, and also legislation stripping the federal courts of jurisdiction over legal assaults on marriage.”“There are other good things of less moment.

First the omission of a bill of rights providing clearly & without the aid of sophisms for freedom of religion, freedom of the press, protection against standing armies, restriction against monopolies, the eternal & unremitting force of the habeas corpus laws, and trials by jury in all matters of fact triable by the laws of the land & not by the law of Nations. . . .

The Supreme Court declares the executive order unconstitutional because it violates the First Amendment right to freedom of the press.“As we consider whether to reauthorize parts of the PATRIOT Act, we must take stock of where we are today. It is no secret that NSA collects vast sums of information and at one point or another has collected information on virtually every person in this country who uses a telephone. That is no great secret. Since June 2013, we have learned that the NSA collects phone call metadata, including the numbers of both parties, location, time, and duration. They collect text messages, email chat, and Internet browsing history; smart phone app data, including Google Maps, which can pinpoint a person's location to within a few yards. They collect maps of people's social networks, bank and credit card transactions. This is just the tip of the iceberg. There is undoubtedly much more being done that we simply don't know anything about.”“The collection of telephone metadata in bulk facilitates our mapping of terrorist networks and our ability to disrupt terrorist plots. Contrary to the wild fantasies that critics frequently spout, this collection does not meaningfully intrude on our privacy. It does not involve the NSA listening in on anyone's calls. It is simply a very important means of finding a proverbial needle in a haystack.

Politicians and their campaigns use these lists to perceive the electorate. The lists help them understand who their supporters are, what issues different voters care about, and how they should present themselves to voters in their campaign appeals. This large-scale collection of data influences how politicians perceive voters, and in turn, it affects how they interact with voters.”“In a pure democracy the people are the sovereign, and their will is declared by themselves; for this purpose they must all come together to deliberate, and decide.

He thinks that free wifi would be a great improvement to his community, but waits for feedback from his constituents before he casts his vote. A majority of citizens in Pawnee support the bill, so Congress member Wyatt decides to vote in favor of it.“As this Court’s cases have made clear, however, the compelling interest that justifies consideration of race in college admissions is not an interest in enrolling a certain number of minority students. Rather, a university may institute a race-conscious admissions program as a means of obtaining ‘the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity’. . . . “Increasing minority enrollment may be instrumental to these educational benefits, but it is not, as petitioner seems to suggest, a goal that can or should be reduced to pure numbers.”“[T]he attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the state, that, in his medical judgment, the patient’s pregnancy should be terminated.

She hopes that by separating the department into two agencies, she can get the Higher Education Agency to work on addressing student loan debt.“An unjust law is a code that a majority inflicts on a minority that is not binding on itself. This is difference made legal. On the other hand, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow, and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal.”“There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid.”“And the closer the 2006 midterm elections got, the more nervous congressional Republicans could be expected to get. Republican leaders in the House of Representatives sought to have the Senate move first, not wanting to have their members go out on a limb with a series of potentially costly party-line roll call votes that would have no policy payoff if Republicans in the Senate decided not to move a bill because they did not have the votes needed to pass it.”The majority party in the Senate wants to vote on a bill that would change requirements for granting citizenship, but a member of the minority party has the floor and continues to debate the bill. /splitsign/politics,nra,laws,law,enforce,legislative,education,congressional,authority,regulation,students,
Following an uptick in juvenile crime, Star City institutes a curfew that prohibits any person under the age of 18 from being in a public place without adult supervision between the hours of 9:00pm and 5:00am.“The Constitution instructs all who act for the government that they may not ‘deny to any person . . . the equal protection of the laws.’ In implementing this equality instruction, as I see it, government decisionmakers may properly distinguish between policies of exclusion and inclusion. Actions designed to burden groups long denied full citizenship stature are not sensibly ranked with measures taken to hasten the day when entrenched discrimination and its after effects have been extirpated.”In United States v. Morrison (2000), the Supreme Court struck down the part of the Violence Against Women Act that made gender-motivated violence a federal crime, as it was not related to the commerce clause.“Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government.

There are A people numbered 1 to A in a football academy.The coach of the academy wants to make two teams (not necessary of equal size) but unfortunately, not all people get along, and several refuse to be put on the same team as that of their enemies.Given a 2-D array B of size M x 2 denoting the enemies i.e B[i][0] and B[i][1] both are enemies of each other.Return 1 if it possible to make exactly two teams else return 0. /splitsign/Graph Data Structure & Algorithms,enemies,array,teams,team,football,equal,academy,numbered,people,coach,
Rishabh takes out his Snakes and Ladders Game, stares the board and wonders: "If I can always roll the die to whatever number I want, what would be the least number of rolls to reach the destination?"RULES:The game is played with cubic dice of 6 faces numbered from 1 to A.Starting from 1 , land on square 100 with the exact roll of the die. If moving the number rolled would place the player beyond square 100, no move is made.If a player lands at the base of a ladder, the player must climb the ladder. Ladders go up only.If a player lands at the mouth of a snake, the player must go down the snake and come out through the tail. Snakes go down only.BOARD DESCRIPTION:The board is always 10 x 10 with squares numbered from 1 to 100.The board contains N ladders given in a form of 2D matrix A of size N * 2 where (A[i][0], A[i][1]) denotes a ladder that has its base on square A[i][0] and end at square A[i][1].The board contains M snakes given in a form of 2D matrix B of size M * 2 where (B[i][0], B[i][1]) denotes a snake that has its mouth on square B[i][0] and tail at square B[i][1]. /splitsign/Graph Data Structure & Algorithms,snakes,snake,rishabh,ladder,ladders,board,climb,dice,rolls,roll,
Given a binary matrix A of size N x M.Cells which contain 1 are called filled cell and cell that contain 0 are called empty cell.Two cells are said to be connected if they are adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.If one or more filled cells are also connected, they form a region. Find the length of the largest region. /splitsign/Graph Data Structure & Algorithms,matrix,cells,cell,binary,adjacent,filled,connected,diagonally,region,vertically,
You are given a AB character matrix named C. Every cell in C has a character U,R,L or D indicating up,right,left and down.Your target is to go from top left corner to the bottom right corner of the matrix.But there are some restrictions while moving along the matrix:If you follow what is written in the cell then you can move freely.But if you don't follow what is written in the cell then you have to pay 1 unit of cost.Like: If a cell contains character U and you go right instead of Up you have to pay 1 unit of cost.So your task is to find the minimum cost to go from top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. /splitsign/Graph Data Structure & Algorithms,matrix,ab,cell,cost,moving,minimum,corner,target,character,left,
Rishabh wants to get a permutation B.Also, Rishabh has some M good pairs given in a form of 2D matrix C of size M x 2 where (C[i][0], C[i][1]) denotes that two indexes of the permutation A.In one operation he can swap Ax and Ay only if (x, y) is a good pair.You have to tell whether Rishabh can obtain permutation B by performing the above operation any number of times on permutation A.If the permutation B can be obtained return 1 else return 0. /splitsign/Graph Data Structure & Algorithms,rishabh,permutation,swap,pairs,matrix,pair,indexes,operation,ax,2d,
