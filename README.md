## Problem Suggesting system based on NLP:Keyword Extraction
As we all known, whether it is a course quiz problem or some algorithm problem like leetcode, the explanation of the problem itself is usually not a sentence, it  tends to be in the form of a small paragraph. 
Using Natural Language Processing method to classify the problems in large quantities into categories based on keywords is now a hot direction in the industry. Compared to traditional methods, NLP based method can save both a lot of labor costs and time. 
This repo shows our implementations with four major parts when completed:

### Search and create problem datasets
Almost Done
### Setup transformer models for Questions and Candidate keywords/keyphrases embeddings.
Implementing Model callup backends.
### Calculate Keywords for each Question and store in question-keyword dict format.
Awaiting implementing.
### Create “Question Finder program” for user searching Questions using one-shot keywords or batch inference interface.
Awaiting implementing.
